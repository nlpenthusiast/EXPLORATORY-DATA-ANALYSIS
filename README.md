** Beijing AirQuality Prediction ** 
This project predicts the density of Particulate Matter
present in air given the relevant atmospheric and weather conditions.
As a prelude to understanding the features and their relationships,
this EDA project gives a deep insight to the dataset in a nutshell.

A Peek into this EDA Project...
Exploratory Data Analysis forms the basis of understanding the predictors, their relationship with the target variable.
It helps in observing important trends in the dataset.

Univariate , Bivariate and Multi-variate analysis :
